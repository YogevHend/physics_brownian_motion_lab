# README

This repository is made to help physics students do the lab in brownian motion
You'll find 2 major scripts here, one that helps analyze growing circles of liquid and another that helps detect radii and motion of circles.
You're supposed to import the script and run main, after changing the paths to be those that are relevant to you. Also notice that you need to install prerequisite libraries before using this script, until I find the time to properly wrap this up.
